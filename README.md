# Wlog
An app to log your walks and more. [Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/116bdy8NFT4XaS16KcoTsyfyiRwZhd-vs/view "WLOG Demo Video")

- Users are able to log their walks by simply dropping pins on on a map
based on their current location as they go off on their daily jog.

- The app logs all users' walks, tracks various data points such as distance, time and
also provides a great set of aggregate data to the user allowing them to easily track their progress

- Data regarding each jog/walk is stored in Firebase, and users are then able to look back 
on their walks/jogs in vivid detail as each walk is presented on a map
with a route traced from where they began and when they edged. 

- The app also provides users with location specific weather forecasts allowing them to
plan ahead for future walks.


- Use the bottom navigation bar to navigate between 
  1) Walks - where users can see all their walks (press the floating button to start a new walk)
  2) Weather - where users can view the weather forcasts for the day and the day after
  3) Stats - a helpful aggregation of user jog data based on distance and time

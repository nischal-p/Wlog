# Wlog
An app to log your walks and more.

- Users are able to log their walks by simply dropping pins on on a map
based on their current location as they go off on their morning/evening jog.

- The app logs all users' walks, tracks various data points such as distance, time and
also provides a great set of aggregate data to the user allowing them to easily track their progress

- Data regarding each jog/walk is stored in Firebase, and users are then able to look back 
on their walks/jogs in vivid detail as each walk is presented on a map
with a route traced from where they began and when they edged. Each jog 
is also given a caption/description to add a sense of uniqueness and importance to each jog/walk.

- The app also provides users with location specific weather forecasts allowing them to
plan ahead for future walks.


- Use the bottom navigation bar to navigate between 
1) Walks - where users can see all their walks (press the floating button to start a new walk)
2) Weather - where users can view the weather forcasts for the day and the day after
3) Stats - a helpful aggregation of user jog data based on distance and time
